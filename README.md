Introduction:
Network scanners are used to identify devices that are connected to a network and collect information about their 
characteristics. Python is a powerful programming language that can be used to develop a network scanner. This report 
provides an overview of network scanning using Python and its benefits.

Methodology:
The network scanner is developed using the Python programming language and the Scapy library. Scapy is a Python-based tool 
that enables users to create, send, and receive network packets. It allows users to manipulate packets at a low level and 
supports a wide range of protocols. The network scanner is designed to scan the local network for devices, their IP 
addresses, MAC addresses, and other details. It uses the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) protocol to obtain the MAC 
address of each device connected to the network. The scanner also employs multithreading to improve its performance.

Results:
The network scanner developed using Python and Scapy successfully scans the local network and retrieves information about 
connected devices. It displays the IP address, MAC address, and other details of each device in a user-friendly format. The 
scanner is fast and efficient due to its use of multithreading. It can also be easily customized to include additional 
features and functionality.

Benefits:
Python is a popular programming language with a large community of developers and users. It is easy to learn, has a simple 
syntax, and provides powerful tools for data analysis and visualization. The Scapy library is a versatile tool that enables 
users to create custom network tools and applications. Developing a network scanner using Python and Scapy provides several 
benefits, including:

Fast and efficient scanning: The use of multithreading enables the scanner to scan the network quickly and efficiently.

Customizable: The scanner can be easily customized to include additional features and functionality.

User-friendly: The scanner displays the results in a user-friendly format, making it easy to understand and interpret.

Versatile: Python and Scapy are versatile tools that can be used to develop a wide range of network applications.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, developing a network scanner using Python and Scapy provides several benefits, including fast and efficient 
scanning, customizability, user-friendliness, and versatility. Python and Scapy are powerful tools that enable developers to 
create custom network applications that meet their specific needs. The network scanner developed using Python and Scapy is a 
valuable tool for network administrators and security professionals.
